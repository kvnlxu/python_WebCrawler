# python_WebCrawler

Simple web crawler written in python 3 with a basic link filter. Run by calling StartCrawler.py. Modifiable settings are at the top of the StartCrawler.py file. The crawler_save file must be removed to start a fresh run. The clean.bat shows an example of how to remove files from previous runs when running with default settings.

#Features to be added
Separate file for default settings
CLI interface for user inputted settings
